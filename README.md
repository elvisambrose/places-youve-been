# Places You've Been

## Author

## Description
This project allows users to record and view places they have visited.  
It demonstrates the use of **constructors and prototypes** in JavaScript,  
with a clean user interface and portfolio‑quality styling.

Users can:
- Add new places with details (name, location, landmarks, time of year, notes).
- View a list of places they’ve added.
- Click on a place to see its details.
- Persist data using localStorage so places remain after refresh.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/places-youve-been.git
